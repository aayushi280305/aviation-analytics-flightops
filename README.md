# ✈️ Aviation Analytics – Flight Operations Forecasting (Capstone)

🚀 **Goal**: Use real-world airline data to predict flight delays, analyze fuel usage, and explore route optimization using time series and ML techniques.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Airlines need accurate forecasting of delays, passenger loads, and fuel burn to optimize operations. This project uses machine learning and statistical models to build such predictions.

## 📊 Key Features (Coming Soon)
- Delay prediction using ARIMA & Random Forest
- ACF/PACF analysis for time series modeling
- Tableau dashboards for visualization
- Exploratory data analysis of route-level patterns

## 🧠 Tools Used
`Python`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`, `matplotlib`, `Tableau`

## 🗂️ Project Structure
# aviation-analytics-flightops
Forecasting flight delays using ML and time series | 

## 📁 Dataset
Using [this Kaggle airline dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maheshdadhich/airline-dataset) for modeling.

## 🛠 Status
✅ Project Initialized  
🚧 Notebooks & models in progress  
📊 Tableau visualizations coming soon
